# ℹ️ A Little About Me:
I'm Silico, a technology lover and gamer who turned curiosity into a path. I grew up in pixel worlds and games, and that curiosity about how systems are built (and how they can be broken) moved me toward offensive security.<br>Today I write and contribute on GitHub, focus on Red Teaming and bug bounty work, and explore how AI can be applied to practical security tasks.<br>I break things so others can build them safer.<br><br> For the full journey, check out my story on Medium: [🔗](https://medium.com/@silicoindustries/silico-story-db4c5292a356)<br><br>Under the name **Silico Software’s / Silico Industries**, I publish tools, scripts, and programs for the cybersecurity community, along with software projects, and soon, AI models.<br><br>All my [links](https://silico-industries.github.io/links/) 💚🖤💚 <br>
